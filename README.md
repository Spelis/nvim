# Spelis/nvim

## Overview

These are my personal Neovim config files, focused on simplicity, speed and practical workflows. Minimal startup time to get you into your editor, faster.

## Features

* Full-fledged LSP setup, easily install new LSP servers with :Mason

* Lazy loading to avoid slow startups

* Beautiful themes out of the box

* Modern UI

## Installation

`git clone https://github.com/spelis/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim`

Make sure you're on the latest neovim. Any issues that occur on earlier versions are your problem.

## Contributing

Very unlikely i will accept PRs, but if its something i actually want, then yes.
